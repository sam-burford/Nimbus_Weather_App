## Introduction

Nimbus is a web-based weather application developed to further my skills in web development and software engineering. This project showcases my proficiency in creating a full-stack web application, with a focus on both frontend and backend technologies, all within the beautiful landscape of Camberley, Surrey, United Kingdom.

## Project Overview

Nimbus provides real-time weather information using external weather APIs. It is designed to be a responsive and user-friendly platform for checking the latest weather conditions. Whether you're in Camberley or anywhere else, Nimbus has got you covered.

## Career Experience

Working on the Nimbus project has enriched my career experience in the following ways:

**Full-Stack Development**: I gained experience in both frontend and backend development, including .NET Core and Angular.js, ensuring a seamless user experience.

**.NET Core**: I improved my skills in building secure, scalable, and efficient web applications using .NET Core for the backend.

**Angular.js**: I learned how to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces with Angular.js, enhancing my frontend development knowledge.

**API Integration**: Implementing external weather APIs expanded my expertise in integrating third-party services.

**Responsive Design**: Designing for multiple screen sizes and resolutions ensures a consistent user experience across devices.

**Version Control**: I used Git and GitHub for version control, allowing for easy collaboration and project management.

## What I Learned

Throughout the Nimbus project, I learned valuable lessons, including: 

- Efficient API design and development for seamless frontend-backend communication. 
- User authentication and authorization to ensure data security and user privacy. 
- Responsive web design principles to ensure a consistent user experience across devices. 
- Effective use of external weather APIs to provide real-time data. 
- Problem-solving and debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues quickly.
- Utilised unit testing to follow a test-driven development (TDD) workflow.
